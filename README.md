This assignment was used to create a portfolio for ourselves to showcase our work and knowledge with both HTML and CSS. Some of the requirements needed for the assignment was that it needed to have our list of works, fully functional navigation, and most importantly a responsive design that allows users to view the website using different screen resolutions.
